This data could be used for various analyses, such as understanding employee turnover, analyzing the effectiveness of promotions, studying performance ratings, and more.

Analysis done:
With the Diversity and Inclusion file, Defined the relevant KPIs in hiring, promotion, performance and turnover, and created a visualisation. Also derived some root causes of their slow progress.

To address this task, we need to define relevant KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) in the areas of hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover. Then, created visualizations for these KPIs and derived some root causes for slow progress.

To derive root causes for slow progress, we can look at the trends in these KPIs over time and identify any patterns or anomalies. For example, if we see that the diversity in new hires is not improving over time, this could indicate a problem with the company's hiring practices. Similarly, if we see that certain groups are consistently receiving lower performance ratings or are more likely to leave the company, this could indicate issues with bias or discrimination.
